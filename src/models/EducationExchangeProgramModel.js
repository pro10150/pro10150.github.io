But, in spite of the bad situation, it gave the opportunity to me, a student with little to no financial support to go to the actual exchange program, to experience an international domain of the education system. I have the opportunity to attend an online exchange program mostly because of COVID-19. Otherwise studying abroad would be just a dream. In this program I've learned about SDGs or Sustainable Development Goals. And have the opportunity to pitch deck the idea that could potentially help my country, Thailand, to become more sustainable in the future. I also got the opportunity to communicate in English, which I didn't get a lot in my home country. It was the important chapter of my life in my English learning path. I'm more comfortable with my English Speaking Skills after this program.",

This program covered lessons about Entrepreneurship from Ideation stage to the Pitching stage. I've learned a lot from this program and hope that one day I'd be able to put it to good use. Even though it was a rather short program compared to UMAP-COIL, but I've learn many thing that I thoguht would be useful to me in the future.",
